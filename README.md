### The Problem üò´
The placement season for any student is a period of high stress and information overload. My inbox was flooded with dozens of emails about job opportunities, test schedules, and company announcements. Manually tracking deadlines, researching each company, and preparing for interviews was time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to human error. I needed a way to automate this entire process.

### The Solution ‚ú®
I engineered the **Autonomous Placement Prep Agent**, a smart system that acts as my personal secretary. It runs 24/7 in the background, reads my emails, understands them using AI, and takes action. It organizes my schedule, does my initial research, and delivers a concise, actionable preparation guide directly to my phone, ensuring I never miss an opportunity and can focus my energy on what truly matters: preparing for the interviews.

### üåä System Workflow
The agent operates on a continuous **Perceive-Think-Act** cycle:

1.  **Perceive:** Every hour, the agent connects to the **Gmail API** to scan for new, unread emails from the placement cell.
2.  **Think (Analysis):** The body of each new email is sent to the **Google Gemini LLM**. The AI analyzes the unstructured text and returns a structured JSON object, classifying the email's intent and extracting all relevant data.
3.  **Act (Tier 1):**
    *   If the email contains deadlines or interview dates, the agent uses the **Google Calendar API** to create corresponding events.
    *   If the email is a "New Opportunity," it triggers the next stage of action.
4.  **Think (Research & Synthesis):**
    *   The agent uses the extracted company name to perform targeted web scraping, prioritizing trusted sources.
    *   All the scraped text is then passed back to the **Google Gemini LLM** with a detailed prompt asking it to act as a "placement mentor" and generate a high-quality prep guide.
5.  **Act (Tier 2):**
    *   The final report is sent via the **Twilio API** as a series of WhatsApp messages.
    *   Finally, the agent uses the **Gmail API** to mark the original email as "read," completing the cycle.
